    Born and rasied in Kansas City Mo. I am a senior at Grandview High School a '24 graduate. I enjoy a lot of computer science and plan to major in it. When it comes to work I like to look at myself as a hard worker. I'm the kind of person that starts something and doesn't stop until it's done. I love working with and meeting new people. I also enjoy going out with friends and family.
